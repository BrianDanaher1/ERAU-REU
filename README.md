## Variable Stride Project

The purpose of this research is to evaluate the Variable Stride Algorithm, a subsampling algorithm, as used in convolutional neural networks. Subsampling is a common technique used in CNNS in order to both increase the training speed of the dataset, with the tradeoff of coarsening the dataset and decreasing the amount of useful information. This algorithm allows the user to section the image and determine the pooling stride, the size of the downsampling filter, in each section. My manipulating these parameters, one can isolate the portions of an image which are most important in classification and only minimally downsample these regions, while more aggressively downsizing the less important parts of the image. 


This research is done in collaboration with the Signal Processing and Applied Mathematics group of the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS), and is a continuation of research performed in Spring 2021 as part of a mathematics capstone project. A team of three worked on this project: myself, Matthew Brown, and Ying Zheng.
