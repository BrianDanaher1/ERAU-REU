## Variable Stride Project

The purpose of this research is to evaluate the Variable Stride Algorithm, a subsampling algorithm, as used in convolutional neural networks. This research is done in collaboration with the Signal Processing and Applied Mathematics group of the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS).



This research is a continuation of research performed in Spring 2021 as part of a mathematics capstone project.
